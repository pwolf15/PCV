* technique for dimensionality reduction
* represent the variability of training data in as few dimensions as possible
* singular value decomposition (SVD) usually used to find principal components

* Pickling: take almost any Python object and convert it to a string representation
* Unpickling: reconstructing Python object from string
* Gaussian blurring, example of image convolution
* Image gradient, image derivatives
* Prewitt filters, sobel filters
* sobel filter used for image derivative; positive => bright, negative derivative => dark
* Gaussian derivative filters: more robust to image noise and derivatives
* morphology: framework and collection of image processing methods for measuring and analyizng basic shapes
* Image de-noising: removing image noise while preserving details and structures
* Rudin-Osher-Fatemi de-noising model (ROF)
* ROF Solver based on Chambolle algorithm
* roll() method: rolls values of array cyclically around an access
* linalg.norm: difference between two arrays
