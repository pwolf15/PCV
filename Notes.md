* technique for dimensionality reduction
* represent the variability of training data in as few dimensions as possible
* singular value decomposition (SVD) usually used to find principal components

* Pickling: take almost any Python object and convert it to a string representation
* Unpickling: reconstructing Python object from string
* Gaussian blurring, example of image convolution
